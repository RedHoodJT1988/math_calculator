# 🧮 Simple Python Calculator
Welcome to the Simple Python Calculator — a terminal-based calculator that covers all the basics (and then some)! Whether you're crunching numbers or just brushing up on Python fundamentals, this project is a great place to start.

## 🚀 Features
This calculator may not solve world peace, but it can do:

- ➕ Addition (supports multiple numbers)
- ➖ Subtraction (two numbers)
- ✖️ Multiplication (supports multiple numbers)
- ➗ Division (with zero division protection!)

## 📊 Percentage calculation

- √ Square root (no negatives allowed!)
- 🔋 Exponentiation (power function)
- 🚪 Exit the program (when you've had enough math)

All wrapped in a friendly command-line interface that prompts the user for input and outputs results in real time.

## 🧠 Why This Project?
This project was built as part of my #30DaysOfPython challenge. It reinforces:
- Basic Python syntax
- Functions with variable arguments
- Input validation and error handling
- Command-line interaction
- Clean, modular code structure
- 💻 How to Use

1. Clone the repo or download the Python file:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RedHoodJT1988/math_calculator.git
cd math_calculator
```
2. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform your desired operation

## 📦 Requirements
Just plain ol’ Python 3. No third-party libraries needed—`math` is standard.

## 🛠 Example
```bash
Simple Python Calculator

 Options:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Percentage
6. Square root
7. Power
8. Exit

Choose an Operation (1 - 8): 1
Enter numbers to add, separated by space: 10 20 30
Result: 60.0
```

⚠️ Notes
- Division by zero? Caught and handled.
- Square roots of negative numbers? Not allowed.
- Invalid inputs? You’ll get a friendly nudge to try again.
